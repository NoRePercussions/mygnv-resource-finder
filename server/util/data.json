The CIL conducts ADA Para-transit Screenings for people with disabilities in Alachua and Marion Counties.\nTo qualify for Para-transit service, a person must meet the criteria of at least one category. Eligibility for Complementary Para-transit Service is directly related to the inability of a person with a disability to use the existing fixed-route service. \n● Category 1: Persons that are unable to use fully accessible fixed-route services. This would include any person who is unable, as a result of a physical or mental impairment (including vision), and without the assistance of another individual to access, board, ride and disembark from the fixed-route system. \n● Category 2: Individuals who need the assistance of a wheelchair lift or other boarding assistance device and are able with such assistance to board, ride and disembark form any vehicle which is readily accessible. \n● Category 3: Any individual with a disability who has a specific impairment-related condition, which prevents such an individual from traveling to a boarding location or from a disembarking location on such a system.\nMore information can be found in the ADA Handbook go-rts.com/files/ada-handbook.pdf \nAs funds are available, the CILNCF builds wheelchair ramps for those in need of this important home modification.Most services are offered to individuals living with disability in one of the 16 counties served.",
